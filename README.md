Simple exercises/projects and codealongs in javascript 

All the projects in this particuler repo are not completely built from scratch.I just use this repo to get track of my practicing of javascript. So, it contains some existing code which i have developed further or some codealongs donw with the help of any course/video.

If you wanna see my own projects on js checkout the javascript-projects repo.

Thank You :)
